<h3>Reverse</h3>

<p>This effect reverses the direction of ring growth. If the rings were expanding, they immediately begin contracting at the same speed, and vice versa. A similar effect can be achieved by changing the sign of the <a href="../Parameters/Ring_Growth.htm">Ring Growth</a> parameter, but the Reverse command is much more convenient.

<p>Reverse is handled separately from the Ring Growth parameter, and does not alter it; they combine to determine ring behavior, as shown below:

</tr><tr>
<td>negative</td><td>no</td><td>contraction</td>

<td>negative</td><td>yes</td><td>expansion</td>

<td>zero</td><td>N/A</td><td>frozen</td>
