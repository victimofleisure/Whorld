<h3>Viewing the demo</h3>

<p>When you run Whorld, you'll see a dialog asking if you want to view the <a href="../Modes/Demo_Mode.htm">demo</a>. This dialog can be permanently suppressed by checking the "don't show me this again" checkbox. The demo can be viewed later, by selecting <span class="cmd">View/Demo</span> from the main menu. To stop the demo, select <span class="cmd">View/Demo</span> again.

<p>During the demo, you can experiment with Whorld's effects. For example, try pressing:

<ul>
<li><span class="key">Backspace</span>, to reverse the direction of <a href="../Parameters/Ring_Growth.htm">ring growth</a> (outward versus inward).
<li><span class="key">F5</span>, to enable/disable <a href="../Effects/Mirror.htm">mirroring</a>.
<li><span class="key">F6</span>, to enable/disable <a href="../Effects/Fill.htm">fill</a> mode.
<li><span class="key">F7</span>, to enable/disable <a href="../Effects/Outline.htm">outlining</a> (this only works while in fill mode).
<li><span class="key">F8</span>, to enable/disable <a href="../Effects/X-Ray.htm">X-Ray</a> (a type of translucency).
</ul>

<p>Note that fill and X-Ray may cause the animation to slow down or become jerky; see <a href="../Loose_Ends/Performance.htm">performance</a>.
