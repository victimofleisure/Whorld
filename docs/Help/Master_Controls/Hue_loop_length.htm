<title>Hue loop length</title>
<body>

<h3>Hue loop length</h3>

<p>The image color normally cycles around the entire <a href="../Color/Color_Model.htm">hue</a> wheel, at the speed and direction dictated by the <a href="../Parameters/Color_Speed.htm">Color Speed</a> parameter. In <a href="../Color/Loop_Hue.htm">Loop Hue</a> mode, cycling is limited to a <em>subset</em> of the hue wheel; hue loop length is the <em>size</em> of the subset, in degrees. Loop Hue must be enabled for hue loop length to have any effect.

<p>If the loop length is zero, Loop Hue makes the image monochromatic: all rings will have the same hue, though they may differ in lightness or saturation. With a small length (e.g. 30°), Loop Hue makes the image nearly monochromatic, but still allows rings to be distinguished from one another by hue.

<p>Hue loop length can be changed via the Master dialog, or MIDI.
