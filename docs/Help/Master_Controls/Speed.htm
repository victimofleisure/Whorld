<h3>Speed</h3>

<p>This setting controls the speed of the entire animation. The value is a percentage of normal speed, ranging from 5 (1/20 of normal) to 2000 (20 times normal). The default setting is 100 (normal). Note that at the lowest speed, the animation still moves, though very slowly; to freeze-frame it, use <a href="../Modes/Pause.htm">Pause</a>.

<p>Speed is implemented as a scaling factor. The following items are scaled (multiplied) by it: <a href="../Parameters/Ring_Growth.htm">Ring Growth</a>, <a href="../Parameters/Color_Speed.htm">Color Speed</a>, and the <a href="../Patches/Oscillators.htm">oscillator</a> frequencies for all <a href="../Parameters/Parameters.htm">parameters</a>.

<p>As speed is increased, the animation may appear jerky, because objects are moving further per frame. Jerkiness may also indicate <a href="../Loose_Ends/Performance.htm">performance</a> problems. Jerkiness can sometimes be improved by increasing <a href="../Options/Display/Frame_rate.htm">Frame Rate</a>. Note that increasing the frame rate also speeds up the animation. To compensate for this, decrease the master speed proportionally.

<p>Speed can be changed via the Master dialog or MIDI, or by moving the <a href="../Modes/Mouse_Modes.htm">mouse</a> vertically while holding down the middle button.
