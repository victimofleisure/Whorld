<h3>Dual-Monitor</h3>

<p>The animation is normally displayed in Whorld's main window, but in dual-monitor mode, a secondary window, called a <em>detached view</em>, is created for the animation. The detached view can be displayed on a different monitor than the main window. This allows you interact with Whorld's GUI (graphical user interface) on one monitor, while viewing the animation full-screen on another. Note that this feature may not work under Windows 2000.

<p>To run Whorld dual-monitor:
<ol>
<li>Extend the Windows desktop onto the secondary monitor. The procedure for doing this depends on the type of graphics card you have; see below.
<li>Select <span class="cmd">Window/Detach</span>.
<li>Drag the detached view onto the secondary monitor.
<li>Select <span class="cmd">Window/Full Screen</span> or press <span class="key">F11</span>.
</ol>

<p>To exit dual-monitor mode, press <span class="key">F11</span> to exit full-screen, and then close the detached view, or select <span class="cmd">Window/Detach</span> again.

<p>Here's how to extend the Windows desktop with an ATI Radeon X800XL. Other graphics cards will have a similar procedure.

<ol>
<li>Connect the secondary monitor, turn it on, and power on the PC.
<li>Run ATI's Catalyst Control Center, and select "Displays Manager".
<li>Look for a monitor icon in the box under "Attached displays currently disabled". If it isn't there, something's wrong.
<li>Drag the monitor icon into the empty gray box above it, and to the right of the box containing the main monitor's icon. A pop-up menu should be displayed. Select the menu's last item, "Extend Main onto CRT".
<li>When asked if you want to keep the changes, select 'Yes'.
</ol>
