<h3>Patch mode</h3>

<p>The patch mode determines what settings are affected when a <a href="../Patches/Patches.htm">patch</a> is <a href="../Playlists/Playing_patches.htm">played</a>. The available modes are as follows:

<dl>

<dt>Full
<dd>In this mode, all settings are affected, so that the patch appears exactly as it did when you saved it. This is the default mode. To select Full mode, use <span class="cmd">Edit/Patch Mode/Full</span> or <span class="key">Shift+F</span>. For a complete list of settings that are stored in a patch, see the table below.

<dt>Geometry
<dd>In this mode, only the <a href="../Parameters/Parameters.htm">parameters</a> and their <a href="../Patches/Oscillators.htm">oscillators</a> are affected. This mode is useful for performing, and particularly when <a href="../Playlists/Crossfading_patches.htm">crossfading</a>, because it allows you to alter the geometry without disturbing your effects and master controls. To select Geometry mode, use <span class="cmd">Edit/Patch Mode/Geometry</span> or <span class="key">Shift+G</span>.

</dl>

<p>Full mode is recommended for beginners, and for editing patches, but it may not always be what you want. For example, if you're controlling the effects manually during a performance, you might not want your patches to modify the effects. Ask yourself this: if <a href="../Effects/Mirror.htm">mirroring</a> is on, and I play a patch that doesn't use mirroring, should mirroring automatically turn off? If the answer is yes, use Full mode, otherwise use Geometry mode.

<p>The patch mode can be changed live via keyboard or MIDI, so another option is to switch back and forth, e.g. you could use Geometry mode for jamming, and Full mode for dramatic changes. Playing a patch in Full mode puts all the settings in a known state, which can be helpful if you get confused while using Geometry mode. The patch mode is saved in the <a href="../Playlists/Playlists.htm">playlist</a>.
