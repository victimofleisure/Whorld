<h3>Movies</h3>

<p>A <em>movie</em> is a file containing a sequence of frames from Whorld's animation. After a movie has been <a href="../Movies/Recording_movies.htm">recorded</a>, it can be <a href="../Movies/Playing_movies.htm">played</a> in Whorld, but to use it in another application, it must be <a href="../Movies/Exporting_movies.htm">exported</a> first.

<p>Movie frames are stored in a <em>non-lossy</em> format, so that the animation can be restored later exactly as it was, with no loss of information. Movies are implemented using <a href="../Snapshots/Snapshots.htm">snapshots</a>, so they're <em>vector-based</em>, rather than pixel-based.

<p>Movie files can be quite large. Typical data rates range from 0.5 to 3.0 MB per second, which means a 1-hour recording can require anywhere from 1.5 to 10 GB. In practice, movies are often at the low end of this range. A movie stores the ring data for each frame, which means a movie's size is proportional to the average number of <a href="../Master_Controls/Rings.htm">rings</a>. Various factors can affect the number of rings; see <a href="../Loose_Ends/Performance.htm">performance</a>.
