<h3>Mouse sensitivity</h3>

<p>This setting changes the sensitivity of the pointing device to horizontal and vertical motion. The larger the value, the more effect motion has. The value is a percentage of normal sensitivity, ranging from 25 (a quarter as sensitive) to 400 (four times as sensitive). The default setting is 100 (normal). Note that this setting only affects Whorld, as opposed to the system mouse settings in the Control Panel, which affect all applications.
