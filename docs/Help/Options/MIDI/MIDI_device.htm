<h3>MIDI device</h3>

<p>This option allows you to select a MIDI device. The list of devices varies, depending on what MIDI hardware is installed. If your PC doesn't have a MIDI device, the only option is "No MIDI input", which disables Whorld's MIDI support.

<p>The default value is "No MIDI input", which means that in order to use MIDI, you must select a MIDI device at least once. Typically, you'll also need to assign specific MIDI messages to Whorld's functions, using the <a href="../../MIDI/MIDI_Setup.htm">MIDI Setup</a> dialog.

<p>If you're using a USB MIDI interface, always connect it to the PC <em>before</em> launching Whorld. If you launch Whorld while the interface is disconnected, your device selection will be lost, and connecting the interface won't make it appear in the device list: you must first exit Whorld, and then connect the interface, re-launch Whorld, and reselect the device.
