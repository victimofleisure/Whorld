<h3>Background Hue</h3>

<p>This is the <a href="../Color/Color_Model.htm">hue</a> of the background color, in degrees. The color's <a href="../Parameters/Background_Lightness.htm">lightness</a> and <a href="../Parameters/Background_Saturation.htm">saturation</a> are controlled separately; if lightness is 0 or 1, or saturation is 0, hue has no effect. The background color is also used as the <a href="../Effects/Outline.htm">outline</a> color in Fill mode.

<p>Note that hue is implemented differently for rings than for the background: for rings, hue is controlled indirectly via <a href="../Parameters/Color_Speed.htm">Color Speed</a>, whereas background hue is an absolute setting. As a result, hue cycling for the background color requires an <a href="../Patches/Oscillators.htm">oscillator</a>. For 360° cycling, set the waveform to "Ramp Up", the amplitude to 180, and the frequency non-zero.
