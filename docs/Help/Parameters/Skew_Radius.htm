<h3>Skew Radius</h3>

<p>Skew Radius is the amount that each ring's origin shifts per frame, in pixels. The direction of the shift is determined by <a href="../Parameters/Skew_Angle.htm">Skew Angle</a>. In small amounts, skew makes the image appear to have depth, or resemble a tunnel. In large amounts, Skew causes the image to be completely biased to one side of the screen, leaving the remainder of the screen empty.
