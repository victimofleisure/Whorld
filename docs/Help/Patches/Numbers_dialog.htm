<h3>Numbers dialog</h3>

<p>This dialog continuously displays the current values of the <a href="../Parameters/Parameters.htm">parameters</a>, as well as the current hue, origin, and ring count. The parameters are captured just before they're passed to the rendering engine, so the displayed values include any modulations via <a href="../Patches/Oscillators.htm">oscillators</a>, and also take into account the <a href="../Patches/Master_Offsets.htm">master offsets</a> and master <a href="../Master_Controls/Speed.htm">speed</a>. To show or hide the dialog, use <span class="cmd">View/Numbers</span>, or <span class="key">Shift+N</span>.
