<h3>Playing patches</h3>

<p>The main reason it's useful to group <a href="../Patches/Patches.htm">patches</a> together in <a href="../Playlists/Playlists.htm">playlists</a> is because this allows you to easily switch from one patch to another. The changes can be manual, or <a href="../Playlists/Autoplay.htm">automated</a>; in either case, you're <em>playing patches</em>.

<p>Patches can be played manually in various ways. One way is by double-clicking them in the <a href="../Playlists/Playlist_dialog.htm">playlist dialog</a>, but this requires the dialog to be visible. In <a href="../Modes/Veejay_Mode.htm">Veejay mode</a>, patches are played via the keyboard, or <a href="../Playlists/MIDI_Mapping.htm">MIDI</a>.

<p>To play patches via the keyboard, you must first <a href="../Playlists/Assigning_keys.htm">assign keys</a> to them. The assignments are stored as part of the playlist. Only the keys A..Z can be assigned to patches.

<p>Patches can be organized into <em>banks</em>. A playlist has twenty banks, and they can be selected via the keyboard's numeric keys: 1..9 select the first nine banks, and 0 selects the tenth bank. The upper ten banks are selected in the same way, but while holding down the <span class="key">Shift</span> key. The keys A..Z can be assigned to different patches in each bank, so the maximum number of patches that can be played via the keyboard is 520.

<p>When playing a patch in a different bank, always select the bank <em>first</em>, and then the patch. For example, if you're currently in bank 1, and you want to play patch F in bank 2, press '2', and then 'F', not the other way around.

<p>Patches that work well together should be placed in the same bank, to minimize the need for bank-switching. Note that to avoid confusion, empty banks can't be selected via the numeric keys; they can only be selected via the playlist dialog.
