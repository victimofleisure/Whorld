<h3>Playlist dialog</h3>

<p>This dialog allows you to create and edit <a href="../Playlists/Playlists.htm">playlists</a>, play <a href="../Patches/Patches.htm">patches</a>, assign keys to patches, and control <a href="../Playlists/Autoplay.htm">autoplay</a>. To show or hide the dialog, use <span class="cmd">View/Playlist</span> or <span class="key">Shift+L</span>. The dialog has its own menus, which differ from the main window's menus, e.g. the File menu opens and saves playlists instead of patches. The dialog's controls are as follows:

<dl>

<dt>Playlist
<dd>This is the list of patches in the current bank. To play a patch, double-click its name in the list. The list can be edited, using cut and paste or dragging; for details, see <a href="../Playlists/Editing_playlists.htm">editing playlists</a>.

<dt>Bank
<dd>This drop-list allows you to select a bank. Banks that contain patches can also be selected via the numeric keys, but to select an <em>empty</em> bank, you must use the drop-list.

<dt>Assign key
<dd>This hotkey control allows you to assign a shortcut key to a patch; for details, see <a href="../Playlists/Assigning_keys.htm">assigning keys</a>.

<dt>Shuffle
<dd>This button affects autoplay mode. When it's pressed, the patches are played in random order; otherwise, they're played sequentially.

<dt>Play
<dd>This button enables autoplay mode. When it's pressed, Whorld plays the patches automatically, like a jukebox. The order depends on the Shuffle setting (see above). The duration of each patch is determined by Patch seconds (see below).

<dt>Patch seconds
<dd>This edit box affects autoplay mode: it sets the duration of each patch, i.e. the interval between patch changes, in seconds. It also sets the range of the Crossfade seconds slider (see below).

<dt>Crossfade seconds
<dd>These controls allow you to specify the playlist's crossfade time, in seconds. When the time is non-zero, each patch change starts an automated <a href="../Playlists/Crossfading_patches.htm">crossfade</a> to the new patch.
