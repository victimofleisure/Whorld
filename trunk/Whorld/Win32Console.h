// The Win32Console object creates a Win32 console and redirects standard I/O
// to it.  This allows a GUI application or DLL to use standard I/O functions
// such as printf and scanf.  The console's screen buffer size can also be
// changed if desired.  All the member functions are static, so there's no need
// to create an instance of this object.  Only the Create function is required.

// Creates a Win32 console and redirects standard I/O to it.
//
// Remarks: Create can be called at any time, but it's usually best to call it
// from the application's InitInstance function, or the DLL's DllMain function.
// Note that if Create succeeds, all standard I/O works: the C file API and the
// C++ streams API, and not only output, but also input, including conio.h
// functions such as getch and kbhit.
//
// Returns: True if successful.

// Changes the size of the Win32 console's screen buffer.
//
// Remarks: If the default screen buffer size (typically 80 columns by 300
// rows) is acceptable, there's no need to call this function.
//
// The specified width and height cannot be less than the width and height of
// the screen buffer's window.  The specified dimensions also cannot be less
// than the minimum size allowed by the system.  This minimum depends on the
// current font size for the console (selected by the user) and the SM_CXMIN
// and SM_CYMIN values returned by the GetSystemMetrics function.
//
// Returns: True if successful.
